C. Project Scope
The purpose of the restaurant reservation system is to make easier and organized the process for reserving tables, managing these bookings, and handling interactions with customers. The system will enable customers to book their desired tables through system, see real-time availability of seats, and get confirmation details via email. It also includes functions for managing tables which helps in assigning them quickly by restaurant workers as well as keeps track on status all day long (open/closed). The system will handle user management, giving the right to customers and staff to make profiles and enter the system based on their roles. The system also provides reports about reservations, table use rates, as well as feedback from customers. These details offer important information for managing a restaurant effectively. With regards to payment section it is going to assist in making transactions online easier; meanwhile notification area makes certain that all reminders or updates related with customer's bookings are sent out promptly. Lastly, the module for feedback will gather and handle customer reviews, aiding the restaurant in ongoing enhancement of its services.

Limitations
Though the restaurant reservation system intends to include necessary functions, there are a few restrictions. The main concentration is on dealing with table reservations and it might not seamlessly blend in with other systems for restaurant management like inventory or staff scheduling because of its limited scope. For real-time updates and notifications, you require a constant internet connection that could impact performance if the connectivity is weak or unstable. The user management module will have basic role assignments, but it may not support more complex permissions. The system can process online payments, but it might lack advanced financial reporting. Lastly, while the system will generate standard reports, custom report generation might be limited.
