Group Name: GROUP 8
Project Title: Restaurant Reservation

## A. Problem Statement:

This investigation is specifically about improving the booking process for Mr. Samgyup in Camarin, Caloocan. There are several important questions that have appeared as the restaurant attempts to uplift customer experience and make operations more efficient:

1. How can they deliver a smooth and easy-to-understand booking experience for customers using different devices to lessen annoyance and enhance reservations?
   
2. What types of plans can Mr. Samgyup use for correct real-time table management, avoiding problems like too many bookings or not fully using the tables?
 
3. What measures can Mr. Samgyup undertake to ensure stable and trustworthy correspondence about reservations, confirmations, and reminders so as to lessen the instances of no-shows and improve satisfaction among their customers?
 
4. What steps can Mr. Samgyup put in action for safe management of customer information? How will he make sure that services are personalized, yet still comply with privacy laws?
 
5. How can we best arrange the tables to take into account things like size of party, time of reservation and what customers prefer? 

These queries will steer the investigation of personalized tactics to assist Mr. Samgyup in enhancing its system for reservations, management of tables, practices in communication and secure data keeping.

## F. Benchmarking

 Benchmarking for Samgyeopsal Restaurant Reservation System vs. Gen Korean BBQ

 1. Booking Conversion Rate
   
•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Currently targeting a 70% booking conversion rate.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Known to achieve a 75% conversion rate.

•	Comparison: Gen Korean BBQ has a slightly higher conversion rate, suggesting their reservation system 
is very effective. To improve our rate, we could streamline our booking process and eliminate any obstacles. 
Checking how they design their booking page might provide insights into making our own system more user-friendly.


2. Repeat Booking Rate
   
•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Aiming for a 40% repeat booking rate.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Likely benefits from a strong customer loyalty program that encourages repeat visits. 

•	Comparison: Gen Korean BBQ’s repeat bookings may be driven by their effective loyalty programs. 
We should consider introducing or enhancing a loyalty program, offering incentives like discounts 
or special deals to encourage repeat customers. 


3. No-Show Rate
   
•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Working to keep the no-show rate below 10%.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Likely uses automated reminders and possibly requires deposits to reduce no-shows.

•	Comparison: If Gen Korean BBQ has a lower no-show rate, their use of reminders and deposit policies might be key. 
Implementing automated email and SMS reminders for reservations, and possibly requiring a small deposit, could help 
reduce our no-show rate.


4. Table Turnover Time
   
•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Targeting a turnover time of 45-60 minutes.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Achieves quick table turnover, possibly due to efficient operations and clear communication about meal times.

•	Comparison: Gen Korean BBQ’s quick turnover might be due to their effective table management and clear policies. 
We should review their approach and consider improving our staff coordination and clearly communicating dining times to customers.


5. Reservation Lead Time
    
•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Aiming for a lead time of 1-2 weeks.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Manages a similar or shorter lead time, potentially through strong promotions.

•	Comparison: If Gen Korean BBQ effectively encourages early bookings through promotions, we should adopt similar strategies. 
Offering discounts or special deals for early reservations could help increase our lead time and better plan for busy periods.

•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Focusing on making the reservation process easy for customers.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Provides a smooth and intuitive booking experience.

•	Comparison: Gen Korean BBQ’s user-friendly booking system is likely a result of their focus on simplicity.

and apply similar improvements to our own system.

•	Samgyeopsal Restaurant: Planning to use automated reminders.

•	Gen Korean BBQ: Likely has effective communication strategies, including timely reservation confirmations and reminders.

•	Comparison: If Gen Korean BBQ excels in customer communication, their methods could serve as a model for us. 
Implementing automated reservation confirmations and reminders, along with follow-up messages, could enhance our 
customer engagement.
