# Restaurant Reservation System 

## INTRODUCTION

 Today, we live in the world where the internet is of absolute importance, as 3 billion people or 45% of the population of the world are using the internet. Due to such rapid developments, the number of people willing to offer their food online services, with the expectation to grow to 60%, has also increased. Getting the Meals people reside in different regions and cities. Nevertheless, there are many restaurants that cannot find enough customers mainly because of lack of marketing and unnecessary indifference to their establishments.

 In order to solve this problem we propose to design an innovative online resource which will make life easier for users and allow them to find available tables at restaurants and see their menus and other offers. This system will be internet based and available on the smartphones, computers and any personal devices that can access the internet. The project aims to cater many people in the Philippines. The development of such an online reservation system is crucial in enhancing restaurant services by replacing manual procedures with a more efficient digital approach.

 As research has shown, long wait times can negatively impact customer satisfaction (Letsa, 2017), and managing reservations digitally can help restaurants better estimate demand, optimize staffing, and ultimately improve profitability (Quang et al., 2018). Additionally, the system addresses the inefficiencies of traditional paper-based reservation methods, which have been shown to create challenges during busy hours (Cunninghams EPOS Group, 2018). By providing a reliable and user-friendly platform, this project aims to improve service quality, a critical factor in customer satisfaction within the restaurant industry (Quang et al., 2018).

## Project Features and Characteristics


## 1. Reservation Module

• Booking: Customers select a date, time, and count of people to make a table 
 reservation.

• Calendar: Shows which times are available or already booked.

• Confirmation: Sends a message to confirm the reservation.

• Customer Records: Keeps track of past reservations.

## 2. Table 

• Table Map: Shows where tables are in the restaurant.

• Assigning Tables: Puts customers at tables based on their booking.

• Live Updates: Shows if tables are free, reserved, or in use.

## 3. User Module

• Customer Info: Saves customer details like name and preferences.

• Staff Roles: Handles different permissions for admins, hosts, and waiters.

• Contact: Lets staff send messages to customers.

## 4. Reports Module

• Booking Reports: Shows daily, weekly, and monthly booking details.

• Table Use: Tracks which tables are used most often.

## 5. Feedback Module

• Feedback: Asks customers how their dining experience was.

• Ratings: Let customers rate their experience.

• Responses: Allows staff to reply to feedback.


## Project Scope

The purpose of the restaurant reservation system is to make easier and organized 
the process for reserving tables, managing these bookings, and handling interactions with 
customers. 
The system will enable customers to book their desired tables through system, see 
real-time availability of seats, and get confirmation details via email/sms. 
It also includes functions for managing tables which helps in assigning them quickly 
by restaurant workers as well as keeps track on status all day long. 
The system will handle user management, giving the right to customers and staff 
to make profiles and enter the system based on their roles. 
The system also provides reports about reservations, table use rates, as well as feedback 
from customers. 
These details offer important information for managing a restaurant effectively. 
Regarding the payment section, it will help streamline online transactions; 
at the same time, the notification area ensures that all reminders and updates related 
to customer bookings are sent out promptly. 
Lastly, the feedback module will collect and manage customer reviews, 
supporting the restaurant in continuously improving its services.

## Limitations

Though the restaurant reservation system intends to include necessary functions, there 
are a few restrictions. The main concentration is on dealing with table reservations and it might
not seamlessly blend in with other systems for restaurant management like inventory or staff 
scheduling because of its limited scope. For real-time updates and notifications, you require a 
constant internet connection that could impact performance if the connectivity is weak or 
unstable. The user management module will have basic role assignments, but it may not 
support more complex permissions. The system can process online payments, but it might lack 
advanced financial reporting. Lastly, while the system will generate standard reports, custom 
report generation might be limited.
